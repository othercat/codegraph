# Dynamic-Dispatch Coverage Playbook

**Audience:** a Claude agent continuing this work.
**Mission:** systematically close static-extraction coverage holes for **dynamic
dispatch** across **every language and framework codegraph supports**, and validate
each one the same way, so cross-symbol *flows* exist in the graph everywhere.

> This is the top-level playbook. The deep design for one mechanism (the callback
> synthesizer) is in [`callback-edge-synthesis.md`](./callback-edge-synthesis.md).
> Full investigation context + findings: auto-memory `project_codegraph_read_displacement`.

## 1. The goal (why this matters)

codegraph's value is being **the map** — answering structural/flow questions
(`trace`, `impact`, callers, "how does X reach Y") that grep/Read cannot. Agents
will use codegraph instead of Read **only when it is sufficient**. We proved
empirically (see memory) that the lever for sufficiency is **coverage**, not
prompting/hooks/new-tools: when a flow is missing from the graph, the agent reads
the files to reconstruct it; when the flow *is* in the graph, the agent can answer
completely without reading.

**Validated end-to-end on excalidraw:** after closing the update-flow hole, 2/3
headless agent runs answered the "how does an update reach the screen" question with
**Read 0 and a complete answer** — impossible before, because the key edge wasn't in
the graph. (Caveat: coverage *enables* the no-read path; agent confirm-by-reading
variance means it doesn't *force* it. Completeness improves unconditionally.)

The mission is to make that true for **all** languages/frameworks.

---

## 2. The problem class: dynamic dispatch

Static tree-sitter extraction captures explicit calls (`foo()`, `this.bar()`). It
**misses** any call whose target is computed/indirect. Four recurring shapes, with a
**difficulty gradient** (do the cheap ones first):

| # | Shape | Example | Fix mechanism | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Named attribute / descriptor** | django `self._iterable_class(self)` | framework resolver (`claimsReference` + `resolve()`) | **cheap** |
| 2 | **Field-backed observer** | `onUpdate(cb)` + `for(cb of cbs)cb()` | callback synthesizer (whole-graph pass) | medium |
| 3 | **String-keyed EventEmitter** | `on('e',fn)` / `emit('e')` | callback synthesizer (event-keyed) | medium |
| 4 | **Inline callback handler** | `on('e', function h(){})` / `() => {}` | extraction (named) + synthesizer link-through-body (anon) | named: cheap · anon: hard |

Key distinction driving the mechanism choice:
- **A named ref exists** to resolve (`_iterable_class` is an attribute name) → **resolver**.
- **No ref exists** (`cb()` is anonymous; needs registrar↔dispatcher correlation) → **synthesizer**.

---

## 3. Worked examples (the two mechanisms, end to end)

### 3a. Django ORM descriptor — the **resolver** pattern (Python)
- **Hole:** `QuerySet._fetch_all` calls `self._iterable_class(self)` (a runtime-chosen
  iterable, default `ModelIterable`), whose `__iter__` runs the SQL compiler. Static
  parsing can't resolve the attribute-as-callable → `_fetch_all`'s only callee was
  `_prefetch_related_objects`; `trace(_fetch_all, execute_sql)` returned no path.
- **Fix:** `djangoResolver` claims the unresolved `_iterable_class` ref through the
  name-exists pre-filter, then resolves it to `ModelIterable.__iter__`.
- **Files:** `src/resolution/types.ts` (`claimsReference?` on `FrameworkResolver`),
  `src/resolution/index.ts` (pre-filter in `resolveOne` consults `claimsReference`),
  `src/resolution/frameworks/python.ts` (`djangoResolver.resolve` + `claimsReference` +
  `resolveModelIterableIter`).
- **Result:** `trace(_fetch_all, execute_sql)` → `_fetch_all → __iter__ → execute_sql` (3 hops).

### 3b. Excalidraw observer + EventEmitter — the **synthesizer** (TS)
- **Hole:** `Scene.triggerUpdate` does `for (cb of this.callbacks) cb()`; `triggerRender`
  is registered via `scene.onUpdate(this.triggerRender)`. The `triggerUpdate →
  triggerRender` edge is dynamic → `trace` returned no path; the whole update flow broke.
- **Fix:** a whole-graph pass that detects registrar/dispatcher channels, correlates
  registration sites, and synthesizes `dispatcher → callback` edges. Plus extraction of
  **named** inline callbacks so handlers like express's `function onmount(){}` are nodes.
- **Files:** `src/resolution/callback-synthesizer.ts` (the pass — field observers +
  EventEmitter), `src/resolution/index.ts` (calls `synthesizeCallbackEdges()` at the end
  of `resolveAndPersistBatched`), `src/extraction/tree-sitter.ts` (`visitFunctionBody`
  extracts named nested functions).
- **Result:** `trace(mutateElement, triggerRender)` → 3 hops; express `use → onmount`.

---

## 4. The repeatable methodology (run this per language/framework)

### Step 1 — Pick the framework's canonical *flow* question
Every framework has a signature data/control flow. Pick the "how does X reach/become Y"
question and a real repo (add to `.claude/skills/agent-eval/corpus.json`). Examples:
- React state→DOM, Vue reactive→render, Svelte store→update
- Rails request→controller→view, Spring request→`@Controller`→service
- Express/Koa request→middleware→handler, FastAPI request→route→dependency
- Redux action→reducer→store, RxJS subscribe→operator→observer
- Any ORM: query builder → SQL execution (django pattern)

### Step 2 — Measure the hole (deterministic, no agent)
```bash
rm -rf <repo>/.codegraph && ( cd <repo> && codegraph init -i )
node scripts/agent-eval/probe-trace.mjs <repo> <from-symbol> <to-symbol>   # does the flow break? where?
node scripts/agent-eval/probe-node.mjs  <repo> <break-symbol>              # trail: is the next hop missing?
```
A "No direct call path … breaks at dynamic dispatch" + a sparse trail at the break
point **locates the hole** (this is exactly how `_iterable_class` and `triggerUpdate`
were found). Confirm it's dynamic by reading the break symbol's body.

### Step 3 — Classify → choose the mechanism (use the §2 table)
- `self.<attr>(...)` / descriptor / metaclass → **resolver** (§3a).
- `for(cb of store)cb()` / `store.forEach(cb=>cb())` → **field-observer synthesizer** (§3b).
- `on('e',fn)` + `emit('e')` → **EventEmitter synthesizer** (§3b).
- Inline handler not a node → **named:** extraction (already done generically in
  `tree-sitter.ts`); **anonymous:** synthesizer link-through-body (not yet built).

### Step 4 — Implement
- **Resolver:** add to `src/resolution/frameworks/<lang>.ts` — a `resolve()` branch +
  `claimsReference(name)` if the ref name isn't a declared symbol. Copy `djangoResolver`.
- **Synthesizer channel:** extend `src/resolution/callback-synthesizer.ts` — add the
  framework's registrar/dispatcher **name patterns** and **body patterns** (e.g. signals
  use `.connect()`/`.emit()`; Rx uses `.subscribe()`/`.next()`).
- Reindex (Step 2 command) and re-run `probe-trace` — the flow should now connect.

### Step 5 — Validate (the same way every time)
1. **Deterministic:** `probe-trace(from,to)` finds the path; `probe-node` shows the
   bridged hop. The previously-broken hop is closed.
2. **Precision:** count + spot-check synthesized/resolved edges — no explosion, correct targets:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 <repo>/.codegraph/codegraph.db \
     "select s.name||' → '||t.name||'  '||coalesce(e.metadata,'') from edges e \
      join nodes s on e.source=s.id join nodes t on e.target=t.id where e.provenance='heuristic';"
   ```
   (Resolver edges aren't `heuristic`; verify via the trace + callees instead.)
3. **Regression:** node count stable (`select count(*) from nodes;` before/after — a big
   jump means an extraction change over-fired); existing traces on a control repo intact.
4. **End-to-end agent eval:** run the flow question with codegraph and measure
   **reads / answer-completeness / cost** vs a pre-fix baseline:
   ```bash
   # headless (exact cost + clean tool sequence)
   bash scripts/agent-eval/run-agent.sh <repo> with "<flow question>"
   # or the full A/B + interactive Explore-subagent path:
   scripts/agent-eval/audit.sh local <name> <url> "<flow question>" all
   ```
   Then parse: `Read` count, codegraph-tool count, cost, and whether the answer now
   contains the glue symbols (the ones that previously required a read).

### Success criteria (per language/framework)
- `trace` finds the canonical flow end-to-end (no dynamic-dispatch break).
- Agent can answer the flow question with **Read 0** (achievable in ≥ some runs) and the
  glue symbols appear in the answer.
- **No node explosion** and no regression on a control repo.
- Synthesized edges are precise on a spot-check (no generic-name over-linking).

## 5. Validation toolkit (reference)

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-trace.mjs <repo> <from> <to>` | call-path between two symbols (the hole detector) |
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-node.mjs <repo> <sym> [code]` | symbol + trail (callers/callees); `code` adds the body |
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-context.mjs <repo> "<task>"` | context output incl. call-paths |
| `scripts/agent-eval/probe-explore.mjs <repo> "<query>"` | explore output |
| `scripts/agent-eval/{audit,run-agent,itrun}.sh` | agent A/B (headless + interactive); also the `/agent-eval` skill |
| `sqlite3 <repo>/.codegraph/codegraph.db` | direct edge/node inspection (provenance, metadata, counts) |

Probe scripts use the built `dist/` — run `npm run build` first. Reindex after any
extraction or resolution change (`rm -rf <repo>/.codegraph && codegraph init -i`) — the
synthesizer/resolvers run at index time. Test fixtures: keep a tiny per-pattern fixture
(see `/tmp/cb-fixture/bus.js`; **move into `__tests__/`** when shipping).

## 7. Known limits & gotchas (from the excalidraw/django work)

- **Coverage enables, doesn't force, the no-read path.** Agents still read to *confirm
  source* sometimes; cost stays ~flat (codegraph calls trade for reads). The reliable
  win is **completeness** + making Read-0 *possible*. Don't expect a guaranteed cost drop.
- **Vue (validated 2026-05-23, vitepress S / vben M / element-plus L).** SFC `<template>`
  is unparsed by the extractor, so template usage needs synthesis (`vueTemplateEdges`):
  `@click="fn"` → handler, kebab `<el-button>` → `ElButton`. PascalCase `<Child/>` is
  already covered by the JSX channel (the SFC component node spans the template). Result:
  agent reads drop in every size (vben login 1–3 vs 4–11), **strongest where handlers are
  local functions** (vben `handleLogin`/`handleSubmit`).
  **Composable-destructure handlers RESOLVED:** `@click="closeSidebar"` where
  `const { close: closeSidebar } = useSidebarControl()` now follows alias → composable →
  the returned `close` fn (when it's defined in the composable's file). vitepress sidebar
  flow dropped **6 → 0 reads** (best case). Precise-only — no fallback to the composable
  itself (the static `useX()` call edge already covers that), so it adds nothing where the
  returned fn can't be located (e.g. re-exported / external composable). Remaining limits:
  **prefix-convention kebab** — element-plus `el-button` → `button.vue` (component named
  `button`, not `ElButton`), so kebab stays unresolved there; and **reactive→render**
  (vue-core Proxy runtime) — the deep framework-internal frontier, deferred.
- **Svelte / SvelteKit (validated 2026-05-23, realworld S / skeleton M / shadcn L) — already well-covered.**
  Unlike Vue, the `.svelte` extractor already parses the template: `extractTemplateCalls` (`{fn()}`),
  `extractTemplateComponents` (`<Pascal/>` composition — skeleton 956 / shadcn 1610 reference edges),
  plus `import * as api` namespace + `load`→api resolution all work. Agent A/B (realworld login): with
  codegraph **1 read** vs without **4** — codegraph already wins out of the box. The one extraction gap
  was **object-of-functions** (`export const actions = { default: async () => {} }`; the walker
  deliberately skips object-literal functions to avoid inline-object noise). Fixed for EXPORTED consts
  (general — Redux/Express handler maps too); `extractFunction` `nameOverride` keeps inline-object arrows
  skipped. **Residual:** a `$lib`-alias namespace call (`api.post`) from an extracted action node doesn't
  resolve even though the same alias resolves for `load` — a deeper resolver interaction, deferred
  (local/relative calls from actions connect). **Lesson: measure before assuming a hole** — modern Svelte
  barely uses `on:click={fn}` (form actions / callback props instead), so the assumed event-handler hole
  wasn't the real one; Svelte needed far less than Vue.
- **Express / Koa (validated 2026-05-23, realworld S / parse M / ghost L) — high-value inline-handler fix.**
  The resolver already handled named handlers, middleware, and `XController.method`/`XService.method`.
  The real hole was **inline arrow route handlers** (`router.post('/x', async (req,res) => {...})` — the
  dominant modern pattern): the handler regex `[^)]+` broke on the arrow's `)`, so the route connected to
  NOTHING and the anonymous handler's body (the request→service flow) was lost. The entire inline-handler
  API was unreachable (realworld `POST /users/login` → 0 edges). Fixed (`frameworks/express.ts`): span the
  call with a string-aware balanced scan; for inline arrows, extract the body's calls (RESERVED-filtered to
  drop res/req/builtins) and attribute them to the route node → realworld **19** / ghost **65** precise
  route→service edges (POST /users/login→login, POST /articles→createArticle, …), no node explosion,
  framework-scoped (zero blast radius off Express). **Deterministic win is clear; the agent A/B is muddied
  by repo characteristics** — realworld (39 files) is below the size where codegraph beats reading, and
  Ghost's layered custom-API architecture makes both arms thrash. Residual: **custom routers** — payload's
  6.4k-file codebase had 0 routes (its router abstraction isn't `app.get`-style, so undetected). Lesson
  inverse of Svelte: Express's dominant pattern WAS the uncovered one, so it needed real work like Vue.
- **NestJS (validated 2026-05-23, realworld S / immich M-L / amplication L) — already well-covered.** The
  `nestjs` resolver handles @decorator routes (HTTP/GraphQL/microservice/WS). DI controller→service
  (`this.svc.method()`) resolves correctly **even at scale** — every immich controller→service edge hit the
  right same-module service (`addUsersToAlbum→addUsers`, `getMyApiKey→getMine`, `copyAsset→copy`) via
  name + co-location, no type_of edge needed. Agent A/B (immich album flow): codegraph **eliminated Grep
  (0 vs 3)** tracing route→controller→service. No dynamic-dispatch hole. One GENERAL hygiene gap surfaced
  (not NestJS-specific): the realworld example **commits its `dist/`** build output, which codegraph indexes
  (246 dup nodes) because the file walk only respects `.gitignore` with no default build-dir ignore. Real
  apps (immich/amplication) gitignore `dist/` (0 dup nodes), so it's narrow — a default ignore for
  `dist/build/out/.next/coverage` is a clean follow-up, deferred (core-indexer change, the user's call).
- **Rails (validated 2026-05-23, realworld S / spree M / forem L) — high-value RESTful-routing fix.** The
  `rails` resolver only saw explicit `get '/x' => 'c#a'` routes, so resource-routed apps (the dominant
  pattern) had ZERO route nodes (realworld + spree). Fixed (`frameworks/ruby.ts`): expand `resources :x` /
  `resource :x` into their RESTful actions (only/except filters + pluralization for the singular `resource`),
  reference a precise `controller#action`, and resolve that to the action method in `<ctrl>_controller.rb`
  (explicit routes fixed too — they referenced a bare ambiguous `action`). realworld **0→16**, forem
  **0→635** precise route→action edges. Agent A/B (forem comment-creation, large): codegraph **1–4 reads /
  0 grep / 47–53s** vs without **4–5 reads / 2–3 grep / 66–85s** — fewer reads, no grep, faster. **The
  `claimsReference` pre-filter was the gotcha:** `articles#index` names no declared symbol, so `resolveOne`
  dropped it before `resolve()` ran — needed the same claim hook as the django ORM work. Residuals: **Rails
  Engine routing** (spree still 0 — it mounts an engine, not `config/routes.rb` resources); ActiveRecord
  dynamic finders (`Article.find_by_slug` — metaprogramming frontier).
- **Spring (validated 2026-05-23, realworld S / mall M / halo L) — bare-mapping + class-prefix routing fix.**
  The resolver required a string path in the mapping regex, so BARE method mappings (`@PostMapping` with the
  path on the class `@RequestMapping`) — the dominant multi-method-controller pattern — were missed (halo
  had 28 routes for 2444 files; realworld's 2-action favorite controller linked only one). Fix
  (`frameworks/java.ts`): treat class `@RequestMapping` as a PREFIX (joined, not a bogus route); match
  verb-specific mappings BARE-or-with-path; also handle method-level `@RequestMapping(method=...)` (older
  style). realworld 13→19, mall →246 precise route→method (class prefix joined); DI controller→service
  resolves (`article→findBySlug`). Agent A/B (mall cart flow): with codegraph 0 reads/0 grep vs without 2/2.
  **A first cut regressed mall 292→1** by dropping `@RequestMapping`-on-method — *caught by the cross-repo
  route-count check*; the playbook's regression guard earns its keep. Residuals: halo's custom patterns
  (9/29 resolve); Spring Data JPA derived queries (metaprogramming frontier).
- **Difficulty gradient is real:** named-ref dispatch (resolver) is cheap; anonymous
  callback dispatch (synthesizer) is medium; **anonymous-arrow handlers are the hard
  remaining gap** (no identity → need synthesizer link-through-body, not yet built).
- **Extraction changes are high blast radius.** The Phase-3 named-inline-callback
  extraction is in the *shared* `tree-sitter.ts` walker — re-check **node counts across
  several languages** after any extraction change (it held at +3 on excalidraw because
  anonymous arrows are skipped).
- **Synthesizer precision guards:** registrar-name uniqueness, named-only handlers, and
  an event **fan-out cap** (skip generic events like `error`/`change`). Receiver-type
  matching (via `type_of` edges) is the planned precision upgrade — deferred.
- **As-built shortcuts** (callback synthesizer): pairs registrar/dispatcher by *file*+field
  (class proxy), regex arg-recovery (named refs only), `provenance:'heuristic'` +
  `metadata.synthesizedBy` (the enum has no `'callback-synthesis'`). See the design doc.
- **Synthesizer runs only in `resolveAndPersistBatched`** (full index) — wire into
  `resolveAndPersist` for incremental sync before shipping.
- **Symbol ambiguity in `trace`:** common names (`render`, `execute_sql`) match many
  nodes; trace picks among them and may start from the wrong one. Trace from the specific
  method, not a class name.

## 8. Definition of done (the whole mission)

For each language × framework: the canonical flow `trace`s end-to-end, an agent can
answer the flow question with Read 0 in at least some runs with the glue present, no node
explosion, no regression — recorded in the matrix (§6) with the validating repo + numbers.
Then ship-prep: tests per mechanism, CHANGELOG, wire incremental, commit.
